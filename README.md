# âš¡ Energy Consumption Forecasting (Keras)

Time-based energy consumption regression using **Keras**.  
This project builds baseline **Sequential** and **Functional** models (with a simple skip connection),
and demonstrates feature engineering with time-derived variables (Hour, DayOfWeek, Holiday, sin/cos transforms).

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used in this project is an **Energy Consumption dataset** provided in **Parquet (`.parquet`)** format:  

ðŸ‘‰ https://drive.google.com/file/d/15paolMz3mbswXbdSYK6bLMOIA45VAcj1/view?usp=sharing

### Key Columns
- `Hour` â†’ hour of the day (0â€“23)
- `DayOfWeek` â†’ day index (0=Monday, 6=Sunday)
- `Holiday` â†’ binary indicator (holiday / not holiday)
- `LightingUsage` â†’ lighting power usage
- `Occupancy` â†’ number of people present
- `EnergyConsumption` â†’ target variable (total energy consumed)

The dataset is structured for **time-based regression**, where engineered features like `Hour_sin`, `Hour_cos`, and `Month_cos` are also included during preprocessing.

## âœ¨ Highlights
- Tabular regression with **Keras** (Sequential & Functional)
- Time features: `Hour`, `DayOfWeek`, `Holiday`, `LightingUsage`, `Occupancy`,
  plus periodic transforms such as `Hour_sin`, `Hour_cos`, `Month_cos`
- (Optional) hyperparameter search with **Keras Tuner**
- Clean EDA â†’ training â†’ evaluation in one notebook
